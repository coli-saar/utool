	Provides basic classes for representing labelled dominance graphs
	and basic algorithms running on them. 
	
	<ul>
		<li> A labelled dominance graph is represented by an object of
			class {@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.graph.DomGraph} (representing
			the unlabelled graph) and an object of class 
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.graph.NodeLabels} (which assigns
			each node a label).
		</li>
		<li> Each node in the graph is associated with 
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.graph.NodeData}, most importantly
			its {@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.graph.NodeType}; similarly for
			edges.
		</li>
	</ul>
