	Provides codecs for dealing with dominance constraints and
	dominance graphs. The following codecs are currently defined:
	<ul>
		<li>domcon-oz (input, output): dominance constraints represented
		as Mozart/Oz terms, as in the old CHORUS demo;</li>
		<li>domcon-gxl (input, output): dominance graphs in the GXL
		graph reprsentation format;</li>
		<li>domcon-udraw (output): dominance graphs in the concrete syntax
		of the uDraw(Graph) graph drawing system.</li>
	</ul>
