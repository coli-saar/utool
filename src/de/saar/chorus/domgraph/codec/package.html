	Provides basic classes for implementing codecs.
	A codec is a class which supports the conversion of an underspecified
	representation in some concrete syntax into a labelled dominance graph
	<i>(input codec)</i> or vice versa <i>(output codec)</i>. <p/>
	
	This package contains the following groups of classes:
	<ul>
		<li>the <i>base classes</i> {@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.codec.InputCodec},
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.codec.OutputCodec}, 
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.codec.GraphOutputCodec}, and
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.codec.PluggingOutputCodec}, from
			which all concrete codec classes are derived;
		</li>
		<li>classes for dealing with <i>codec management</i>:
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.codec.CodecManager};
		</li>
		<li>classes for various <i>exception</i> that can occur while either using
		or registering a codec.</li>
	</ul>
	
	Codecs are classes with a fairly strictly defined interface. They
	are not intended to be instantiated by an application directly.
	Instead, they are registered in a codec manager object by their
	name and associated filename extension, and then the application
	can request fresh codec objects by name or extension from the
	codec manager.
