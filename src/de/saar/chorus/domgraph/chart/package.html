	Provides classes for working with dominance charts. Dominance
	charts are underspecified representations that are a bit more
	explicit (and potentially larger) than dominance graphs, but
	still exponentially smaller than the set of solved forms itself.<p/>
	
	Roughly speaking, this package contains three types of classes:
	<ul>
		<li> classes for <i>representing</i> dominance charts: 
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.chart.Chart},
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.chart.Split};</li>
		<li> classes for <i>computing</i> dominance charts: 
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.chart.ChartSolver} and
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.chart.SplitSource} and its subclasses;</li>
		<li> classes for <i>enumerating solved forms</i> from a dominance chart:
			{@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.chart.SolvedFormIterator}.</li>
	</ul>
	<p/>
	
	The lifecycle of a chart is as follows. You can compute it from a
	compact weakly normal dominance graph by creating a <code>ChartSolver</code>
	for the graph and running its {@link de.saar.chorus.domgraph.chart.ChartSolver#solve()} method.
	You may then apply further operations to the chart, such as redundancy
	elimination. Finally you can extract the solved forms from a chart
	by creating a <code>SolvedFormIterator</code> for it.
