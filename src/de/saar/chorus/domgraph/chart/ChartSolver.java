/**
 * A solver for compact weakly normal dominance graphs. This solver computes
 * a {@link Chart} as described in Koller & Thater (2005), "The evolution
 * of dominance constraint solvers", ACL-05 Workshop on Software. It
 * can be seen as an implementation of the Bodirsky et al. 2005 graph
 * solver.<p>
 * 
 * This solver requires that the input dominance graph is weakly normal
 * and compact. It will successively compute the splits corresponding
 * to the free fragments of the subgraphs of the dominance graph, and
 * adds them to the chart.<p>
 * 
 * The solver relies on an object of a subclass of {@link SplitSource} 
 * to provide the splits of a subgraph. By default, it uses
 * an object of the class {@link CompleteSplitSource}, which computes
 * all splits of this subgraph. Alternatively, you can provide
 * a split source which only adds a certain subset of all splits
 * to the chart.<p> 
 * 
 * Notice that the role of this class is only to fill the chart. The actual
 * solved forms can later be extracted from the chart using a
 * {@link SolvedFormIterator} object.
