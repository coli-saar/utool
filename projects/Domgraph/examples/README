chain3.clls:
	the pure chain of length 3

test.clls:
	a normal dominance constraint with 132 solved forms

thatwould.clls:
	The MRS output (translated into a normal dominance constraint)
	that the English Resource Grammar (as of 2001) generates for
	the sentence 
	
	   "But that would give us all day Tuesday to be there."

	This constraint has 64.764 solved forms. (Expect the solver to
	take a while to output all solutions to the constraint.)

rondane-1.mrs.pl:
	The MRS description of the Rondane Treebank (2005-02-15)
	sentence #1: 

          "The well-known and historic Aurlandsdalen Valley, was 
           once one of the main routes between the eastern and western 
           parts of Norway.

        This MRS has 675 solved forms (i.e. scopings), but is pretty
        hard for the standard LKB solver. Utool needs just a few
        milliseconds to solve it.

rondane-1409.mrs.pl:
        The MRS description of the Rondane Treebank (2005-02-15)
        sentence #1409:

          "Dinner is typically three courses: a soup, a main dish 
           and a light dessert."

        This MRS has 48 solved forms (i.e. scopings), but is pretty
        hard for the standard LKB solver. Utool needs just a few
        milliseconds to solve it.
       
rondane-650.mrs.pl:
	The MRS description of the Rondane Treebank (2005-02-15)
	sentence #650: 

          "Myrdal is the mountain terminus of the Flåm rail line (or
	   Flåmsbana) which makes its way down the lovely Flåm Valley
	   (Flåmsdalen) to its sea-level terminus at Flåm."

	This is the MRS with the most solved forms in the Rondane
	treebank; it has about 2.4 trillion solved forms. We estimate
	that utool would need more than a year to enumerate all these
	solved forms (run 'utool solve -s -n examples/rondane-650.mrs.pl'
        on a Linux system to get a runtime estimation).

rondane-1262.mrs.pl
rondane-892.mrs.pl
	The MRS descriptions for the following two sentences,
	extracted from the Rondane treebank (Jan 2006).

	  "For travellers going to Finnmark there is a bus service
	  from Oslo to Alta through Sweden." (Rondane 1262)
	
	  "We quickly put up the tents in the lee of a small hillside and cook
  	  for the first time in the open." (Rondane 892)


holesemantics-14.hs.pl:
	A Hole Semantics USR from the Hole Semantics testsuite
	available as part of the software package at
	http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~jbos/comsem. This is a
	representation for the following sentence:

	   "Every man in a restaurant knows a woman with a car."

        The sentence has 14 readings. The solver described in the
        Blackburn & Bos textbook takes about 14 seconds to enumerate
        all pluggings. Utool needs about 10 milliseconds.
