           Calling Utool from Prolog
           -------------------------
           
This folder contains a file that will let you connect to the Utool Server from a Prolog program.  What you will do is to consult the file "utool-interface.pl".  This will define the predicate "utool_request", which sends requests to Utool via a socket (as described in the Utool manual) and parses the results.

The Prolog Utool interface was developed and tested under Sicstus Prolog.  We encourage you to try it under different dialects of Prolog, assuming that you understand that it may not work as expected due to Prolog differences.  You will need the Sicstus XML library in this case, which you can get at http://www.sics.se/sicstus/docs/latest/html/sicstus/XML.html.

The Prolog interface was developed by Stefan MŸller (Stefan.Mueller@cl.uni-bremen.de) in the context of the Trale grammar development system and Stefan's Grammix distribution (http://www.cl.uni-bremen.de/Software/Grammix/), and kindly provided to Utool as a contributed package.
