underspecification that we call Constraint Language for 
Lambda-Structures (CLLS). A lambda-structure can be 
considered as a lambda-term up to consistent renaming 
of bound variables (alpha-equality); 
a constraint of CLLS is an underspecified description of a 
$\lambda$-structure. CLLS solves a capturing problem 
omnipresent in underspecified scope representations. 
CLLS features constraints for dominance, 
lambda binding, parallelism, and anaphoric links. Based on 
CLLS we present a simple, integrated, and underspecified 
treatment of scope, parallelism, and anaphora.}

  abstract={Dominance constraints for finite tree structures are widely
used in
several areas of computational linguistics including syntax,
semantics, and discourse. In this paper, we investigate algorithmic
and complexity questions for dominance constraints and their
first-order theory. We present two NP algorithms for solving dominance
constraints, which have been implemented in the concurrent constraint
programming language Oz. The main result of this paper is that the
satisfiability problem of dominance constraints is NP-complete.
Despite this intractability result, the more sophisticated of our
algorithms performs well in an application to scope
underspecification. We also show that the existential fragment of the
first-order theory of dominance constraints is NP-complete and that
the full first-order theory has non-elementary complexity.},

 a constraint-based treatment of descriptions: we develop a
 formulation in terms of sets, which is simple and declarative, and,
 at the same time, constitutes an efficient implementation.  We further
 show how the treatement of tree descriptions can be extended to
 DAG descriptions and apply it to a description-based account of
 discourse.},

We elaborate on the foundations of a recent approach to reinterpretation within a framework for semantic underspecification. In this approach, relaxed underspecified semantic representations are inferred from the syntactic structure, leaving space for subsequent addition of reinterpretation operators. Unfortunately, a structural danger of overgeneration is inherent to the relaxation of underspecified semantic representations. We identify the problem and distinguish structural properties that avoid it. We furthermore develop techniques for proving these properties and apply them to prove the safety of relaxation in a prototypical syntax/semantics interface. In doing so, we present some novel properties of tree descriptions in the constraint language over lambda structures (CLLS).},

notion of model. We then extend the framework to disjunctive systems
of electrostatic descriptions, and we correspondingly extend the

realized by reduction to a CSP solvable by constraint programming and
we provide the full encoding in an axiomatic style.},

  manipulating record like structures in constraint programming,
  computational linguistics and in concrete applications like software
  configuration management.  Feature trees model records, and
  constraints over feature trees yield extensible and modular record
  descriptions.  We introduce the constraint system
FT${}_\leq$ of 
  ordering constraints interpreted over feature trees. Under the view 
  that
  feature trees represent symbolic information, the relation
$\leq$
  corresponds to the information ordering (``carries less information
  than''). We present two algorithms in cubic time, one for the
  satisfiability problem and one for the entailment problem of
FT${}_\leq$.
  We show that
FT${}_\leq$
has the independence property.  We are thus able
  to handle negative conjuncts via entailment and obtain a cubic
  algorithm that decides the satisfiability of conjunctions of
  positive and negated ordering constraints over feature trees.
  Furthermore, we reduce the satisfiability problem of Dörre's weak
  subsumption constraints to the satisfiability problem of
FT${}_\leq$ and
  improve the complexity bound for solving weak subsumption
  constraints from $O(n^5)$ to $O(n^3)$.},

  abstract = {Linear precedence in so-called free word order languages remains challenging for modern grammar formalisms.  To address this issue,
 we describe a new framework for dependency grammar, with a modular
 decomposition of immediate dependency and linear precedence.  Our
 approach distinguishes two orthogonal yet mutually constraining
 structures: a syntactic dependency tree (ID tree) and a topological
 dependency tree (LP tree).  The ID tree is non-projective, and even
 non-ordered, and
 its edges are labeled by syntactic roles. The LP tree is
 projective, partially ordered, and its edges are labeled by
 topological fields.  The shape of the LP tree is a
 flattening of the ID tree's obtained by allowing nodes to `climb
 up'.  Our theory of ID/LP trees is formulated in terms of
 (a) lexicalized constraints and (b) principles governing e.g. climbing
 conditions.  We illustrate it with a detailed account of word order
 phenomena in the verbal complex of German verb final sentences.},

 abstract = {Trees with labeled edges have widespread applicability, for example for the representation of dependency syntax trees.  Given a fixed
 number of nodes and constraints on how edges may be drawn between
 them, to find solution trees is known as a `configuration' problem.
 In this paper, we formalize the configuration problem of labeled trees
 and argue that it can be regarded as a constraint satisfaction problem
 which can be solved directly and efficiently by constraint
 propagation. Our approach takes advantage of constraints on finite
 sets as well as of a new family of `selection' constraints.  We
 further entertain various reinements of interest to the computational
 linguist such as lexical ambiguity, valency constraints, and
 grammatical principles.
 
 This framework generalizes our MOL6 presentation
 \textit{``Axiomatizing Dependency Parsing Using Set Constraints''}
 which addressed the treatment of immediate syntactic dependence when
 parsing with a dependency grammar and paves the way for a
 corresponding treatment of linear precedence based on a notion of
 topological rather than syntactic dependencies.},

 it is essential to be able to decide satisfiability and enumerate

 brute force enumeration.  However it can be addressed very effectively
 by constraint propagation as provided by modern constraint technology.
 
 Previously, we studied the conjunctive fragment of tree descriptions
 and showed how the problem of finding minimal models of a conjunctive
 tree description could be transformed into a constraint satisfaction
 problem (CSP) on finite set variables.
 
 In this paper, we extend our account to the fragment that admits both
 negation and disjunction, but still leaves out quantification.  Again
 we provide a reduction to a CSP.  While our previous encoding
 introduced the reader to set constraints and disjunctive propagators,
 we now extend our arsenal with selection propagators.},
