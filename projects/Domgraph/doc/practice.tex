\begin{itemize}
\item some benchmark results
\item practical tips:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb?java -server?
\item Notice that the server expects that you have encoded special
characters in the USR as XML character entities -- that is, that you
have replaced the \" character by \verb?&quot;?, etc. You should also
be aware that according to the XML specification, whitespace within an attribute is ignored. If the concrete syntax of an input codec requires that there are newlines (e.g.\ to terminate a comment line in the domcon-oz codec), you must encode this newline character as the character entity \verb?&#xA;?.
