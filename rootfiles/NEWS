unreleased  3.2
    - This release of Utool includes a new solver for dominance graphs
      that don't have to be weakly normal or compactifiable.  Starting
      with this release, Utool can deal with Kallmeyer & Romero style
      USRs.

    - Ubench now uses a new graph layout algorithm by default.  This
      layout algorithm is based on the internal chart data structure
      and looks much better than the old layout algorithm for many
      graphs.

    - Improved integration with MacOS.  Utool should now look and
      feel like a native application on a Mac.


2006-11-24  3.1.1
    - Some minor bugfixes.


2006-11-13  3.1
    - Much more of the functionality of Utool is now also
      available from Ubench.  For instance, Ubench now supports
      codec options and offers simple control over the Utool
      Server.  Moreover, Ubench now has a GUI for displaying
      and modifying dominance charts and supports printing.
      
    - The Utool Server now no longer waits for the client to
      close its socket, but starts working immediately after
      recognising a command.  This makes it easier to access
      from programming environments that don't support the
      socket shutdown function.

    - Architecture change: Codecs now contain metadata as Java 5.0
      annotations. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code
      in a codec class, and allows us to use codec options in a
      uniform way, both from the command line and from Ubench.
      
    - The examples that come bundled with Utool can now be
      accessed as "ex:examplename", i.e. they can be used without
      unpacking the Utool Jar file.
      
    - Ubench can now be started directly via a link from the
      website (Java Webstart).
      
    - Many minor improvements and bug fixes.
      

2006-06-19  3.0
    - This is a complete reimplementation of Utool in Java, which
      makes it more portable, more stable, and on some platforms, even
      more efficient. We have taken the opportunity to completely
      redesign the system architecture, which is now much cleaner.

    - Utool now contains the Underspecification Workbench (Ubench), a
      GUI frontend from which most of Utool's functionality can be
      accessed. 

    - Utool can now run in "server mode", which accepts commands via a
      socket and sends the results back over the socket too.

    - New functionality: Utool can now eliminate logical redundancy
      using the algorithm described in Koller & Thater's paper at ACL
      2006.

    - New codecs:
      * term-prolog and term-oz output simple solved forms as terms in
        Prolog and Oz syntax.
      * domgraph-dot outputs labelled dominance graphs using the "dot"
        graph description language, which can be used from a variety
	    of tools such as graphviz.

    - Licence change: The entire Utool package is now distributed
      under the GPL because it is linked against Getopt. We might
      change this licence to something less restrictive in the future,
      but at this point this just seems to be the most convenient way
      to go.

    - Many minor bugfixes.


2005-08-10  2.0
    - The new input codec "domcon-gxl" will now read dominance graphs
      in the XML-based GXL format. This codec uses the Xerces-C
      library for XML parsing, and will only be compiled in if the
      "configure" script can find your Xerces-C installation 
      (RFE #1060866). 

    - The new input codec "mrs-xml" will now read MRS descriptions in
      XML syntax. Like domcon-gxl, it uses the Xerces-C library; this
      codec too is only compiled if the library is available 
      (RFE #1060865).

    - Implemented a new algorithm for enumerating the solved forms of
      a chart. The new implementation is about 10% slower than the
      older one, but it is much clearer and supports incremental
      enumeration.

    - Portability improvements: Utool can now be compiled under Windows 
      using Microsoft Visual C++ and the Intel C++ compiler. Starting
      with this release, we provide a binary distribution for
      libdomgraph and utool under Windows.

    - Portability improvements: Utool can now be compiled using Gnu
      C++ versions 3.4 and 4.0 because the source code conforms more
      strictly to ISO C++.

    - Portability improvements: The Swig/Java integration now also
      works under Windows and Mac OS X.

    - Architecture change: This distribution now builds two targets:
      Libdomgraph (a dynamic library that contains all the former
      utool functionality) and utool (which is now just a command-line
      frontend to libdomgraph). Libdomgraph continues to be
      distributed under the LGPL; utool is licenced under the GPL.

    - The Swig/Java integration is now much more powerful and provides
      methods e.g. for solving an underspecified description and
      accessing the solved forms.

    - Fixed bug #1224183, which caused the holesem-comsem output codec
      to generate syntactically ill-formed Prolog terms for some
      inputs.


2005-04-26  1.2.2
    - The Hole Semantics input and output codec will now correctly
      read and write Hole Semantics descriptions in the format used by
      the (official) software package at
      http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~jbos/comsem/.  

    - Added the output codec domcon-udraw, which converts the
      underspecified description as a graph suitable for display in
      the uDraw(Graph) tool available at
      http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph/en/index.html.


2005-04-08  1.2.1
 
    - Fixed bug #1179115: Utool now consistently uses exit codes >=
      128 to signal errors. The exact exit codes are described in
      exitcode.h.

    - The MRS input codec now understands the "geq" atom that is
      occasionally used in the ERG.

    - Leaf-labelledness can now be checked, e.g. by utool classify.

    - Provided code that makes it possible to use utool functionality
      from Java programs (in tools/java).


2005-03-31  1.2

    - Supports the command "classify". This command checks whether an
      underspecified description belongs to one of the interesting
      subclasses of dominance graphs (normal, compact, compactifiable,
      hypernormally connected) and returns the result in the exit
      code (RFE #1060869).

    - The input codec "mrs-prolog" provides full support for MRS in
      Prolog syntax, as used in the LKB system.

    - The output codec "plugging-lkb" prints solved forms as MRS
      pluggings that can be used in the LKB system.

    - Provided code for the integration of utool with the LKB system
      (in tools/lkb).

    - Codecs are now associated with filename extensions, and utool
      will guess the codec for a file with such an extension.

    - The commands "convert", "solve", and "solvable" now check more
      carefully whether they are applicable on the input graph. In
      particular, "solve" and "solvable" require that the graph is
      weakly normal and compactifiable (RFE #1060876).

    - Fixed bug #1169258: Dominance edges into non-roots are now moved
      up to the respective roots.


2005-02-25  1.1

    - Supports the command "solvable". This command only checks
      whether an underspecified description has any readings (rather
      than actually computing them, as "solve" does), and doesn't
      enumerate them all. The command also computes the number of
      readings of a solvable description.

    - The codec "holesem-comsem" provides full support for Hole
      Semantics in the syntax of the Blackburn & Bos Computational
      Semantics book.

    - The codec "domcon-gxl" is an output codec for dominance graphs
      in the XML-based GXL format.


2004-11-05  1.0

    Initial version.  Supports the commands "solve" and "convert", and
    the codecs "domcon-oz" and "chain".
